## Maps

I've seen some great maps recently.

* [Most Remote Spots in USA Wilderness Complexes](http://www.peakbagger.com/report/report.aspx?r=w)
* [How America Uses Its Land](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-us-land-use/)
* [Very Detailed Map of the 2016 Election](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/07/25/upshot/precinct-map-highlights.html)
* [11 Regions Underlying the 50 States](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/opinion/urban-rural-united-states-regions-midterms.html)

## [Monads are monoids](http://newartisans.com/2017/05/monads-are-monoids/)

> just how much category theory was needed to establish this fact?

Not so much after all!
