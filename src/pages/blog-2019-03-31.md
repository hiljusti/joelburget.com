## [Executable Component-Based Semantics](https://pdmosses.github.io/papers/Binsbergen2019ECBS/preprint.pdf)

> The potential benefits of formal semantics are well known. However, a substantial amount of work is required
> to produce a complete and accurate formal semantics for a major language; and when the language evolves,
> large-scale revision of the semantics may be needed to reflect the changes. The investment of effort needed to
> produce an initial definition, and subsequently to revise it, has discouraged language developers from using
> formal semantics. Consequently, many major programming languages (and most domain-specific languages)
> do not yet have formal semantic definitions.

> To improve the practicality of formal semantic definitions, the PLanCompS project has developed a
> component-based approach. In this approach, the semantics of a language is defined by translating its
> constructs (compositionally) to combinations of so-called fundamental constructs, or ‘funcons’. Each funcon
> is defined using a modular variant of Structural Operational Semantics, and forms a language-independent
> component that can be reused in definitions of different languages. A substantial library of funcons has been
> developed and tested in several case studies. Crucially, the definition of each funcon is fixed, and does not
> need changing when new funcons are added to the library.

> For specifying component-based semantics, we have designed and implemented a meta-language called
> CBS. It includes specification of abstract syntax, of its translation to funcons, and of the funcons themselves.
> Development of CBS specifications is supported by an integrated development environment. The accuracy
> of a language definition can be tested by executing the specified translation on programs written in the
> defined language, and then executing the resulting funcon terms using an interpreter generated from the
> CBS definitions of the funcons. This paper gives an introduction to CBS, illustrates its use, and presents
> the various tools involved in our implementation of CBS.
