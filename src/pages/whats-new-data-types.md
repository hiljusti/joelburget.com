In June 2015, I published [*The algebra (and calculus!) of algebraic data types*](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/three/algebra-and-calculus-of-algebraic-data-types) in [Code Words](https://codewords.recurse.com/). I saw it on Hacker News yesterday and thought now would be a good time to revisit the post. There's a lot I didn't have space to cover in the original or didn't know.
