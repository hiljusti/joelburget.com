## Projects:

[github.com/joelburget](https://github.com/joelburget)

## Noteworthy / significant contributions:

Unfortunately most of my paid work is not open-source. However, I do have some public projects I'm proud of.

* [khan/react-components](https://github.com/khan/react-components): React components originally from within Khan Academy that I open-sourced. This is the first example that I know of publishing React components on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), now standard practice.
* [Khan/perseus](https://github.com/Khan/perseus): Khan Academy's exercise editing system. I wrote the integration between Perseus and the main website. Creating and saving exercises; creating, saving, moving, renaming questions within an exercise.
* [Khan/KAS](https://github.com/Khan/KAS): Khan Academy's computer algebra system. I created simple physics / units of measure support, so you can, say, answer a question in /kg/, when the answer was originally stated in /g/.
* [joelburget/react-live-editor](https://github.com/joelburget/react-live-editor): A tool for live editing react components in the browser, used on the react-components [landing page](http://khan.github.io/react-components/).
* [joelburget/react-haskell](https://github.com/joelburget/react-haskell): Bindings in Haskell for Facebook's React JavaScript library. It works well considering that it's Haskell running in the browser to drive UIs. But this is the project where I learned when to quit.  I wrote about using react-haskell for user interfaces [on my website](http://joelburget.com/react-haskell/).
* [joelburget/haste-compiler:commonjs](https://github.com/joelburget/haste-compiler/tree/commonjs): I took an existing Haskell-to-JavaScript compiler and integrated it with conventional JavaScript tools (CommonJS modules), so that you can more easily use Haskell and JavaScript together.

Many of my projects fall in this niche I've carved out for myself in the intersection between UI and typed functional programming. I enjoy applying the lessons I've learned from each domain to the other.

## Work:

* Khan Academy - Software Developer (2011-2015): I worked on many things during my time at Khan Academy -- search / autocomplete, tooling, frontend UI, etc. Full-stack Python / JavaScript web development.
* Consultant (Oct 2015 - Feb 2016): I worked as a front-end web consultant with a specialiation in React / Flux. I worked with [Spring](https://www.shopspring.com/) where I built their web search feature and [AlphaSheets](http://www.alphasheets.com/) where I helped with architecture and best practices.
* JP Morgan - New Product Development Engineer - Vice President (Feb 2016 - Feb 2018): I worked on adding Raft-based consensus to the Ethereum Virtual Machine / Blockchain. Before that I worked on a functional programming language called Hopper.
* [Monic](https://www.monic.co/) - Cofounder (Feb 2018 - July 2019): Mostly focused on building the [Pact property checking system](https://blog.monic.co/introducing-the-pact-property-checker/).
* [Google](https://google.com) - Software Engineer (August 2019 - present)
