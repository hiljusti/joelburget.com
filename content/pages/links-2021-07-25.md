### [How will OpenAI + GitHub's Copilot affect programming? - LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YkQdokmutQim4T34u/how-will-openai-github-s-copilot-affect-programming)

> Everything below the function prototype was AI generated. And, this code has TWO security vulnerabilities! First, it's using an http URL, rather than https. And second, if the input string has newlines, it can put values into fields other than the ones intended.

### [Processing Semi-Structured Data in the Unix Shell | weaselhat](http://www.weaselhat.com/2021/06/29/processing-semi-structured-data-in-the-unix-shell/)

> I built a new tool that lets you use your usual shell tools to work with modern file formats:  [ffs, the file filesystem](https://mgree.github.io/ffs/) .

### [Introducing PathQuery, Google's Graph Query Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09799)

> We introduce PathQuery, a graph query language developed to scale with Google's query and data volumes as well as its internal developer community. PathQuery supports flexible and declarative semantics. We have found that this enables query developers to think in a naturally "graphy" design space and to avoid the additional cognitive effort of coordinating numerous joins and subqueries often required to express an equivalent query in a relational space. Despite its traversal-oriented syntactic style, PathQuery has a foundation on a custom variant of relational algebra — the exposition of which we presently defer — allowing for the application of both common and novel optimizations. We believe that PathQuery has withstood a "test of time" at Google, under both large scale and low latency requirements. We thus share herein a language design that admits a rigorous declarative semantics, has scaled well in practice, and provides a natural syntax for graph traversals while also admitting complex graph patterns.

### [Hacker News on error correction](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27729226)

> The push for crypto without ecc ram is a nonstop horror show. Software under normal circumstances is remarkably resilient to having its memory corrupted. However crypto algorithms are designed so that a single bit flip effectively changes all the bits in a block. If you chain blocks then a single bit flip in one block destroys all the blocks. I've seen companies like msps go out of business because they were doing crypto with consumer hardware. No one thinks it'll happen to them and once it happens they're usually too dim to even know what happened. Bit flips aren't an act of god you simply need a better computer.

### [Welcome Polygenically Screened Babies - Astral Codex Ten](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/welcome-polygenically-screened-babies#comment-2300538)

> The average US diabetic in 2013 spent [$85,000](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23953350/) in direct medical costs over a lifetime (about $100,000 in today's dollars).
> Add these two up, and Type 2 Diabetes costs the average American diabetic $835,000. With a 4 in 10 chance of getting type 2 diabetes at some point in one's life, the average future American will lose $334k to type 2 diabetes.

> My overall conclusion is that if we somehow end up banning pre-implantation genetic testing it will be one of the worst decisions we have ever made. The impact would be on-par with a worldwide ban on vaccines or sewage systems. It would likely cost the average person around 5 years of healthy life. In fact I think it will be so bad for the citizens of a country that anyone who can afford to will probably leave to get it done elsewhere, since the cost of the plane flights to get IVF done will be trivial compared to the lifetime benefits of reducing polygenic disease risk.

### [1285 foot deep hand-dug well](https://www.mybrightonandhove.org.uk/places/utilities/woodingdean-well/woodingdean-well) (deeper than the Empire State Building is tall)

### [Life Advice: Become a Billionaire | Applied Divinity Studies](https://applieddivinitystudies.com/billionaire/)

### [Against SQL](https://scattered-thoughts.net/writing/against-sql/)

Strong endorsement.

### [What I learned from Software Engineering at Google](https://swizec.com/blog/what-i-learned-from-software-engineering-at-google/)

Makes several interesting points.

> Programming is about writing code. You take a task and write code to solve it.
> Software engineering is when you take that piece of code and consider:
* How will this task evolve?
* How will this code adapt to those changes?
* What does this code encourage others to do?
* How does this code encourage other programmers to use it?
* How will I understand this code in 5 months?
* How will a busy team member jumping around grok this?
* What happens when the business becomes bigger?
* When will this code stop being good enough?
* How does it scale?
* How does it generalize?
* What hidden dependencies are there?
