### OCaml libraries

* [lwd: Lightweight document](https://github.com/let-def/lwd)

> Lwd is a library that lets you build values that changes over time. It is a simple form of incremental computation, in the like of  [Incremental](https://github.com/janestreet/incremental)  and  [React](https://github.com/dbuenzli/react) .
> It is only about interactivity. A bunch of companion libraries make it usable in different settings:

*  [Nottui](https://github.com/let-def/lwd/blob/master/lib/nottui)  renders user interface in the terminal
*  [Nottui-lwt](https://github.com/let-def/lwd/blob/master/libt/nottui-lwt)  add support for concurrent/asynchronous UI to Nottui
*  [Nottui-pretty](https://github.com/let-def/lwd/blob/master/lib/nottui-pretty)  is an interactive pretty-printer (based on  [Pprint](https://github.com/fpottier/pprint) )
*  [Tyxml-lwd](https://github.com/let-def/lwd/blob/master/lib/tyxml-lwd)  is a Js_of_ocaml library for making interactive applications, using Lwd for updating the DOM and  [Tyxml](https://github.com/ocsigen/tyxml)  for writing typesafe HTML Document.


### [How management by metrics leads us astray ‚Äì Jakob Greenfeld ‚Äì Experiments in Entrepreneurship and Learning](https://jakobgreenfeld.com/metrics)

[Hacker News comment:](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25856257)

> Greenfeld comes perilously close to independently discovering Hayek. Local, specialized knowledge is essential, and is one of the hardest features to scale, if it‚Äôs possible at all.

### [Still Alive - Astral Codex Ten](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/still-alive)

Slate Star Codex is back! Kind of. Also, [Lorien Psychiatry](https://lorienpsych.com).

Also from Lorien Phyciatry, [SSRIs](https://lorienpsych.com/2020/10/25/ssris/). "Will an SSRI change me into a different person?"

> Sometimes people ask this question from a philosophical perspective, so I‚Äôll start with a philosophy-style answer: does caffeine change you into a different person? Does alcohol? Does stress? Does depression? Does pregnancy? Does the birth control pill? Does falling in love? All of these change your brain chemistry, some of them in profound ways. Some of them change how you act, pretty noticeably. Does that mean you‚Äôre a different person? Read  [Derek Parfit](http://home.sandiego.edu/~baber/metaphysics/readings/Parfit.PersonalIdentity.pdf)  for a good answer; my mediocre answer is something like ‚Äúthese things make you act differently but don‚Äôt make you feel a rupture in your sense of continuity with yourself.‚Äù

The languages that everybody uses are too hard to apply formal methods to. Languages that are easy to apply formal methods to don't get used because they're not what people already know and write.
