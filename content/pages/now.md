# What I'm Doing Now

### Work

At Google, working on developer productivity (IE saving developer time, automating manual processes, removing friction).

### Personal Projects

Mostly working on [LVCA](https://lvca.dev), exploring ideas for how I would like programming to work.

### Traveling / Exploring

Mostly on-hold due to COVID-19.

### Fiction

  - Rereading The Lord of The Rings
  - Henry James: The Portrait of a Lady
  - Shakespeare's Henriad

### Games

  - I didn't expect to like it, but [Hades](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/) has become one of my all-time favorite games

### Nonfiction

  - [Practical Foundations of Mathematics](http://www.paultaylor.eu/prafm/) (this book is fantastic)

### Writing

I try to post at least biweekly here and on [lvca.dev](https://lvca.dev/).

### Cooking

Lately I've been cooking a lot from the [Bavel cookbook](https://baveldtla.com/bavel-cookbook/)
