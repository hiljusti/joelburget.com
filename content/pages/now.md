# What I'm Doing Now

### Work

At Google, 80% working on developer productivity, 20% working on a library for chip layout with the quantum team.

### Personal Projects

Mostly working on [LVCA](https://lvca.dev), exploring ideas for how I would like programming to work.

Mostly on-hold due to COVID-19.
