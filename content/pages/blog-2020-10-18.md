### [Kindling projects](https://nedbatchelder.com/text/kindling.html)

> New programmers often need small projects to work on as they hone their skills. Exercises in courses are too small, and don’t leave much room for self-direction or extending to follow the interests of the student. “Real” projects, either in the open-source world or at work, tend to be overwhelming and come with real-world constraints that prevent experimentation and pure coding practice.

> Kindling projects are meant to fill this gap: simple enough that a new learner can take them on, but with possibilities for extension and creativity. Large enough that there isn’t one right answer, but designed to be hacked on by a learner simply to flex their muscles.

I used to use a ray tracer as my go-to kindling project. This is a good source of ideas for fun projects.

### [Matching GPT-3's performance with just 0.1% of its parameters](https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/iufpur/matching_gpt3s_performance_with_just_01_of_its/)

> In our most recent paper, we show that language models are few-shot learners even if they have far less than 175B parameters. Our method (combining PET and ALBERT) performs similar to GPT-3 on SuperGLUE after training on 32 examples with just 0.1% of its parameter count: https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07118

Seems a bit misleading: where's the language generation?

### - [Some interesting tidbits about the White House Physician](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/j4ocb1/some_interesting_tidbits_about_the_white_house/)

* 'Reagan's doctor called the job "vastly overrated, boring and not medically challenging". He couldn't attend state dinners due to lack of space but had to wait in his office wearing a tuxedo!'
* "The White House has a much larger medical staff than you'd think necessary: 5 military doctors, 5 PAs, 5 nurses, 3 paramedics (and 3 admins and 1 IT manager)."
* and lots more interesting tidbits
