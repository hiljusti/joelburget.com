## [Radix Trees -- How IntMap Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0udjkEiCjog)

Nice talk by Tikhon Jelvis.

## [What FP can learn from Smalltalk by Aditya Siram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baxtyeFVn3w)

## [The Mundanity of Excellence: An Ethnographic Report on Stratification and Olympic Swimmers](https://fermatslibrary.com/s/the-mundanity-of-excellence-an-ethnographic-report-on-stratification-and-olympic-swimmers)

## Regular expression derivatives

## [United Monoids](https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/andreymokhov/united-monoids/)

> In this blog post we will explore the consequences of postulating 0 = 1 in an algebraic structure with two binary operations (S, +, 0) and (S, ⋅, 1). Such united monoids have a few interesting properties, which are not immediately obvious

## [Fun with Semirings](http://stedolan.net/research/semirings.pdf)

Abstract

> Describing a problem using classical linear algebra is a very well-known problem-solving technique. If your question can be formulated as a question about real or complex matrices, then the answer can often be found by standard techniques.
>
> It’s  less  well-known  that  very  similar  techniques  still  apply where instead of real or complex numbers we have a closed semiring, which is a structure with some analogue of addition and multi-plication that need not support subtraction or division.
>
> We define a typeclass in Haskell for describing closed semirings, and implement a few functions for manipulating matrices and polynomials  over  them.  We  then  show  how  these  functions  can be  used  to  calculate  transitive  closures,  find  shortest  or  longest or  widest  paths  in  a  graph,  analyse  the  data  flow  of  imperative programs,  optimally  pack  knapsacks,  and  perform  discrete  event simulations, all by just providing an appropriate underlying closed semiring.

## More on simplices

## Game-theoretical semantics

Game where we choose the existentially-bound variables:

    forall δ. exists e. forall x. | x - x_0 | < e => | f(x) - f(x_0) | < δ

Skolem function = "my strategy in choosing values for existentially bound variables"

    exists s. forall δ. forall x. | x - x_0 | < s(δ) => | f(x) - f(x_0) | < δ

Call the two players "myself" and "nature"

Definition of a game `G` on a sentence `S`:

* (G.A) If `A` is atomic, then I have won `G(A)` and nature has lost if
      `A` is true. If `A` is false, nature has won and I have lost.
* (G.&) `G(S1 & S2)` begins by nature's choice of `S1` or `S2`. The rest of
      the game is `G(S1)` or `G(S2)`, respectively.
* (G.v) `G(S1 v S2)` begins by my choice of `S1` or `S2`. The rest of the
      game is `G(S1)` or `G(S2)`, respectively.
* (G.U) `G((x)S(x))` begins by nature's choice of a member of `D`. Let
      the name of the member chosen be `b`. The rest of the game is then
      `G(S(b)))`.
* (G.E) `G((exists x)S(x))` is defined likewise except that `b` is chosen by
      myself.
* (G.~) `G(~S)` is played  like `G(S)` except that the roles of the two
      players(as defined by these rules) are interchanged.

> The truth of a sentence `S` of `L` can be defined as the existence of a winning strategy in `G(S)` for myself, i.e., a way of choosing my moves such that I end up winning no matter what nature does. The falsity of `S` likewise means that nature has a winning strategy in `G(S)`.

> But who says that either one of us has a winning strategy? The law of excluded middle says so. On the basic game theory we now see that this law is by no means trivial or unproblematic. For in general it is not a foregone conclusion that there should exist a winning strategy for either one of the two players in a zero-sum two-person game.
