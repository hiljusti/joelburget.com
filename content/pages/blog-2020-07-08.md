[Is Boeing or Airbus Better](https://thepointsguy.com/news/is-boeing-or-airbus-better-we-asked-an-airline-pilot/) (from an avionics point of view)
  - "Launched in 1984, the A320 was a clean-sheet design that incorporated digital fly-by-wire control systems. It was revolutionary at the time, with side-sticks replacing traditional yokes and extensive use of glass displays instead of mechanical dials and gauges on the flight deck. With the A320, Airbus transformed how pilots interact and fly the airplane. Fly-by-wire meant that pilots sent their inputs [to a computer](https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/columnist/cox/2014/03/30/fly-by-wire-cockpit-controls/7026935/) that would then [move the control surfaces.](https://thepointsguy.com/news/how-airplane-wings-work/)
  - "The twin-engine Boeing 737 goes back over 50 years, with a first flight in 1967. It was a descendant of two early Boeing planes, the four-engine 707 and the 727 tri-jet. The 737’s cabin and flight deck width are still the same size as the original 707 that first went into service in the 1950s.
  - "Over 10,000 737s have been delivered to airlines. The aircraft has been stretched and upgraded over the years, the latest being the 737 MAX series with the latest CFM International turbofans and distinctive winglets. They are so different that the first 737, the 100 model, was 94 ft long and had a maximum takeoff weight of 110,000 lbs — but the latest, the MAX 10, stretches to 144 ft and can weigh up to 194,000 lbs.
  - “On the Airbus, you don’t know what the other pilot is doing in terms of control inputs whereas on a Boeing, I’ve got instant feedback on how hard my copilot is working, or how little he’s working on the situation. That’s always troubled me on an Airbus. I’ve looked over and my copilot is just mangling the side-stick — left, right, forward, back — like it’s a video game or something, and I’ve said ‘Whoa, slow down and take it easy!’”
  - “There’s a lot that Airbus does right. If the airline came to me and said, ‘You can only fly either the 737 or the Airbus for the rest of your career,’ I’d go with the Airbus.”

  - "Modelica, as the name suggests, is a modeling language. Which type of models? Mathematical models. Modelica does not focus on a particular application domain, and gives you the freedom to model a variety of problems ranging from electro-mechanical systems for automotive or aerospace applications, to financial models for banks.
  - "You can use the language to create mathematical models using any combination of the following formalisms
    * differential equations
    * algebraic equations
    * difference equations
    * discrete event systems

Designed by Albert Strange in 1909, she is a well-known and important historic vessel – but after many adventures she was left in a remote port in Oregon to rot for decades, despite some valiant attempts to rescue her. I bought her and moved her to the Olympic Peninsular earlier this year, and am now starting to rebuild her from the keel up. Eventually I hope to sail her back to the UK.

[Algebraic models of simple type theories: a polynomial approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16949)
  - We develop algebraic models of simple type theories, laying out a framework that extends universal algebra to incorporate both algebraic sorting and variable binding. Examples of simple type theories include the unityped and simply-typed λ-calculi, the computational λ-calculus, and predicate logic.
    - Simple type theories are given models in presheaf categories, with structure specified by algebras of polynomial endofunctors that correspond to natural deduction rules. Initial models, which we construct, abstractly describe the syntax of simple type theories. Taking substitution structure into consideration, we further provide sound and complete semantics in structured cartesian multicategories. This development generalises Lambek's correspondence between the simply-typed λ-calculus and cartesian-closed categories, to arbitrary simple type theories.
